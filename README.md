## What is Google Foobar Challenge?
The best answer I found sounds like this:

> Foobar is a semi-secret hiring challenge Google put out there to find talented developers via somewhat unconventional yet fitting means. Foobar is a series of five levels of algorithmic questions of ever-increasing difficulty and allotted time to solve these questions. Once the developer requests a question, the clock starts ticking.
> 
> * Level 1: One Question — 48 hours
> * Level 2: Two Questions — 72 hours for each question
> * Level 3: Three Questions — 7 days for each question
> * Level 4: Two Questions — 2 weeks for each question
> * Level 5: One Question — 22 days
>
> For every problem, you can either submit a solution written in Python (2.7) or Java. Before submitting, you can also validate your solution and run it against a suite of secret tests. You aren’t told the test cases, though, only if your algorithm passes the test or not.
