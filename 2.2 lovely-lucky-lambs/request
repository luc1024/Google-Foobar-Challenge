Requesting challenge...
You got the bunny trainers to teach you a card game today, it's called Fizzbin. It's kind of pointless, but they seem to like it and it helps you pass the time while you work your way up to Commander Lambda's inner circle.
New challenge "Lovely Lucky LAMBs" added to your home folder.
Time to solve: 168 hours.
